# Codex handoff

Updated: 2026-08-19

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/lukedupont/bento-shop-feed-summer-26`
- Branch: `luke/feed-topic-polish`
- Handoff remote: `public` (`lukerenedupont/bento-shop-feed-summer-26`)
- Use the latest commit on this branch as the handoff baseline.

## Current prototype

The feed is personalized for Luke, Mikhail, Tobi, Katarina, Kenny, and Archie.
Each buyer receives authored For You and topic feeds backed by the local buyer
profile/catalog data. Feed presentation is shared across buyers rather than
forked into per-profile views.

### Feed and topic behavior

- For You opens at the utility rail and resets there when revisited.
- The first feed card smoothly takes over the viewport as the utility rail
  leaves, and subsequent cards share the same full-bleed snap geometry.
- Cards retain a 40pt bottom radius and expose the next-card peek above the
  bottom navigation.
- Topic feeds enter in the normal full-width white-background state and reuse
  the same header navigation component.
- Topic drill-ins preserve buyer context and use shared-view navigation.
- Authenticated shelf exports for every preview buyer contribute privacy-safe
  shelf type, persona, price-band, quality, and related-shelf signals. Raw
  hypotheses, queries, activity, suppression history, and provenance stay out
  of the app bundle.
- Topic drill-ins use those relationships for featured collections and require
  both semantic and price-band fit before showing canonical merchant cards.
- Lifestyle covers are selected from verified topic/product/merchant media;
  merchant cards require a verified bundled wordmark and merchant-owned cover.
- The 10 canonical Luke topics now prefer approved merchant-owned covers from
  exact PDP galleries or relevant Nocs, Fellow, and Extra Butter editorial
  pages. Feed cards, topic headers, and topic feature cards share the same
  `FeedCoverCatalog` decision and retain the bundled covers as load fallbacks.

### Shared presentation components

- `BuyerFeedNavigationBar.swift` owns the buyer avatar and top-level topic
  chips, including the selected white pill and shared shadow treatment.
- `FeedCardStyle` owns shared card radius, spacing, peek, and bottom-navigation
  clearance tokens.
- `GravityShadows` and `GravityTypography` own utility, selected-topic, feed
  contrast, and editorial typography treatments.
- Feed cards, merchant cards, posts, and product cards share the same contrast,
  corner, favorite-heart, and typography conventions.
- Utility cards use a shared horizontal snap rail and consistent card/product
  sizing. Luke currently exposes the Your orders example.

### Holiday banner variant

Tap the buyer avatar and use **Holiday banner** to choose:

- Off
- Header
- Feed card

`HomePage.SeasonalPlacement` is persisted through `seasonalPlacement`. The
legacy `holidayHeaderEnabled` value is migrated on first use.

`SeasonalSavingsSurface` owns the shared campaign image, copy, and CTA so the
header and card cannot visually drift. `HolidayFeedCard` adds real buyer
products in a horizontally snapping rail. The rail uses shared feed clearance
tokens and interpolates its inset during takeover, keeping complete product
tiles above the bottom navigation in both compact and snapped states.

## Data boundaries

- Buyer feeds and utility items come from the existing personalized catalog.
- Merchant cards only render when a canonical merchant identity, bundled
  wordmark, and verified lifestyle cover are available.
- Shop Posts are exposed through `ShopPostService.posts(for:)`; curated post
  availability is currently implemented for Luke only.
- The holiday CTA is intentionally a prototype hook until the campaign has a
  canonical collection destination. Product tiles route to real PDPs.

## Verification

Simulator:

- Device ID: `286EAAB0-C6BC-41CB-A40C-B84318D400D8`
- Bundle ID: `com.shopify.purl.prototype.shop.feed.summer.26`

Build:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShopFeedSummer26.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ShopFeedSummer26 \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=286EAAB0-C6BC-41CB-A40C-B84318D400D8' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/shop-feed-derived build
```

The build, personalized-feed validation phase, and `git diff --check` pass.
Existing unrelated Swift concurrency warnings may remain.

## Design intent

- Keep Shop UI direct, restrained, native, and media-led.
- Preserve shared geometry across buyers; do not add per-buyer layout forks.
- Use lifestyle media for feed covers and merchant-owned assets for merchant
  cards.
- Keep editorial titles heavy with controlled multiline leading.
- Avoid bounce or content reflow in the vertical snap interaction.
- Top-level tabs move horizontally; content drill-ins use shared-view depth.
