# Codex handoff

Updated: 2026-09-01

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/lukedupont/bento-shop-feed-summer-26`
- Branch: `luke/feed-topic-polish`
- Handoff remote: `public` (`lukerenedupont/bento-shop-feed-summer-26`)
- Use the latest commit on this branch as the handoff baseline.

## Current prototype

The feed is personalized for Luke, Mikhail, Tobi, Katarina, Kenny, and Archie.
Each buyer receives authored For You and topic feeds backed by the local buyer
profile/catalog data. Feed presentation is shared across buyers rather than
forked into per-profile views.

### Feed and topic behavior

- For You opens at the utility rail and resets there when revisited.
- The first feed card smoothly takes over the viewport as the utility rail
  leaves, and subsequent cards share the same full-bleed snap geometry.
- Cards retain a 40pt bottom radius and expose the next-card peek above the
  bottom navigation.
- Topic feeds enter in the normal full-width white-background state and reuse
  the same header navigation component.
- Topic drill-ins preserve buyer context and use shared-view navigation.
- Authenticated shelf exports for every preview buyer contribute privacy-safe
  shelf type, persona, price-band, quality, and related-shelf signals. Raw
  hypotheses, queries, activity, suppression history, and provenance stay out
  of the app bundle.
- Topic drill-ins use those relationships for featured collections and require
  both semantic and price-band fit before showing canonical merchant cards.
- Lifestyle covers are selected from verified topic/product/merchant media;
  merchant cards require a verified bundled wordmark and merchant-owned cover.
- The 10 canonical Luke topics now prefer approved merchant-owned covers from
  exact PDP galleries or relevant Nocs, Fellow, and Extra Butter editorial
  pages. Feed cards, topic headers, and topic feature cards share the same
  `FeedCoverCatalog` decision and retain the bundled covers as load fallbacks.

### Shared presentation components

- `BuyerFeedNavigationBar.swift` owns the buyer avatar and top-level topic
  chips, including the selected white pill and shared shadow treatment.
- `FeedCardStyle` owns shared card radius, spacing, peek, and bottom-navigation
  clearance tokens.
- `GravityShadows` and `GravityTypography` own utility, selected-topic, feed
  contrast, and editorial typography treatments.
- Feed cards, merchant cards, posts, and product cards share the same contrast,
  corner, favorite-heart, and typography conventions.
- Utility cards use a shared horizontal snap rail and consistent card/product
  sizing. Luke currently exposes the Your orders example.

### Opt-in World prototypes

Luke’s experimental Worlds are disabled by default and can be enabled
individually from the avatar/overflow feed-controls sheet. Following and Deals
can also be hidden there without altering the underlying authored feeds.

- `WorldDomain.swift` owns World identity, context, lifetime, session state, and
  preference persistence. Parent/child relationships remain separate from
  identity.
- `CanvasAgentWorldDestination.swift` owns the Watch Canvas presentation,
  steering, shared chrome alignment, and feed-cover Canvas preview.
- `CanvasAgentInfiniteProductCanvas.swift` is the source-aligned Canvas engine
  adapted from `shopify-playground/canvas-agent` at commit `a5957f4`.
- `CanvasAgentSupport.swift` is the adapter seam between canonical Shop
  products and Canvas products.
- `VerySpecialWatchCatalog.swift` owns the deterministic 47-watch snapshot from
  Very Special’s official Watches collection, including canonical prices,
  imagery, and PDP destinations.
- `WorldExperienceViews.swift` contains the remaining lightweight World forms;
  Canvas no longer shares that implementation file.

The Watch Canvas feed card uses a noninteractive instance of the real Canvas
engine as its cover. Opening it restores full pan, zoom, density, steering,
product actions, and Shop PDP routing. The destination computes its own safe
area chrome, so callers provide only the World session, resolved products, and
close action.

### Holiday banner variant

Tap the buyer avatar and use **Holiday banner** to choose:

- Off
- Header
- Feed card

`HomePage.SeasonalPlacement` is persisted through `seasonalPlacement`. The
legacy `holidayHeaderEnabled` value is migrated on first use.

`SeasonalSavingsSurface` owns the shared campaign image, copy, and CTA so the
header and card cannot visually drift. `HolidayFeedCard` adds real buyer
products in a horizontally snapping rail. The rail uses shared feed clearance
tokens and interpolates its inset during takeover, keeping complete product
tiles above the bottom navigation in both compact and snapped states.

## Data boundaries

- Buyer feeds and utility items come from the existing personalized catalog.
- Merchant cards only render when a canonical merchant identity, bundled
  wordmark, and verified lifestyle cover are available.
- Shop Posts are exposed through `ShopPostService.posts(for:)`; curated post
  availability is currently implemented for Luke only.
- The holiday CTA is intentionally a prototype hook until the campaign has a
  canonical collection destination. Product tiles route to real PDPs.

## Verification

Simulator:

- Device ID: `286EAAB0-C6BC-41CB-A40C-B84318D400D8`
- Bundle ID: `com.shopify.purl.prototype.shop.feed.summer.26`

Build:

```sh
xcodebuild -project ShopFeedSummer26.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ShopFeedSummer26 \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=286EAAB0-C6BC-41CB-A40C-B84318D400D8' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/shop-feed-derived build
```

The clean simulator build, personalized-feed validation phase, and
`git diff --check` pass. The clean app product is approximately `184020 KB`
against the enforced `184320 KB` budget. Existing unrelated Swift concurrency
warnings may remain.

## Design intent

- Keep Shop UI direct, restrained, native, and media-led.
- Preserve shared geometry across buyers; do not add per-buyer layout forks.
- Use lifestyle media for feed covers and merchant-owned assets for merchant
  cards.
- Keep editorial titles heavy with controlled multiline leading.
- Avoid bounce or content reflow in the vertical snap interaction.
- Top-level tabs move horizontally; content drill-ins use shared-view depth.
